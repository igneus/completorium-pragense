# Completorium secundum Rubricam pragensem

LaTeX sources for a booklet of chanted Compline according to the
medieval diocesan use of Prague.

Literal quotations of texts and rubrics from 16th c. early prints
of the Prague breviary (always citing the exact source)
are, if necessary, supplemented with explanatory notices
(always marked as such) and, most importantly, by chant notation
collected from manuscript sources (always cited).

Goal is to make relatively easily available at least a partial experience
of the medieval liturgy, while not watering down peculiarities
of the original liturgical books.

It should be noted that the booklet doesn't reproduce (often very
lengthy and complex) calendar rules. Anyone interested in assembling
a full calendar "as the Prague Metropolitan Chapter would have used it
if it followed its early 16th c. calendar up to this day"
still has to dive deep in the sources.
We don't expect most of the booklet's users to be interested in this kind
of hardcore medievalism.
