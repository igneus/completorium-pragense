# Completorium secundum rubricam pragensem

LaTeX sources for a booklet of chanted Compline according to the
medieval diocesan use of Prague.

Literal quotations of texts and rubrics from 16th c. early prints
of the Prague breviary (always citing the exact source)
are, if necessary, supplemented with explanatory notices
(always marked as such) and by chant notation
collected from manuscript sources (will be cited, but currently
are not, in case of interest please consult annotations in
transcription source files, directory `cantus/`).

Goal is to make relatively easily available at least a partial experience
of the medieval Divine Office, while not watering down peculiarities
(language, organization) of the original breviary.

It should be noted that the booklet doesn't reproduce (often very
lengthy and complex) calendar rules. Anyone interested in assembling
a full calendar "as the Prague Metropolitan Chapter would have used it
if it followed its early 16th c. calendar up to this day"
still has to dive deep in the sources.
We don't expect most of the booklet's users to be interested in this kind
of hardcore medievalism.
